## Code Structure

### General Guidelines

- Use ES6+ features when appropriate
- Prefer functional components over class components
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use named exports for better IDE support and code clarity

### Component Structure

Components should follow this general structure:

```jsx
// Imports
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

// Component JSDoc
/**
 * Component description
 * 
 * @param {Object} props - Component props
 * @returns {JSX.Element} Component
 */
const ComponentName = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // State declarations
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
  
  // Custom hooks
  
  // Effects
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effect logic
    return () => {
      // Cleanup logic
    };
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  // Event handlers
  const handleEvent = () => {
    // Event handling logic
  };
  
  // Helper functions
  
  // Conditional rendering
  if (condition) {
    return <div>Alternative rendering</div>;
  }
  
  // Main render
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
};

// PropTypes
ComponentName.propTypes = {
  prop1: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  prop2: PropTypes.number
};

// Default props
ComponentName.defaultProps = {
  prop2: 0
};

export default ComponentName;
```

## Naming Conventions

### Files and Folders

- Use PascalCase for React components: `UserProfile.jsx`
- Use camelCase for utility files: `authHelpers.js`
- Use kebab-case for CSS files: `button-styles.css`
- Group related files in descriptive folders

### JavaScript

- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and instance methods
- Use PascalCase for classes and component names
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Boolean variables should have prefix: `is`, `has`, `should`

### CSS

- Use descriptive class names that indicate purpose
- Avoid overly generic names
- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology when possible
- Prefer component-scoped styling (MUI styled components)

---

## React Component Patterns

### Functional Components

- Use functional components with hooks for almost all cases
- Use arrow function syntax for component definitions
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks

### Props

- Destructure props in function parameters
- Use prop spreading sparingly, prefer explicit props
- Document props with JSDoc and PropTypes

### Hooks

- Follow the Rules of Hooks
- Use custom hooks to share logic between components
- Keep hook dependencies accurate in useEffect

### Context

- Use Context for global state that many components need
- Split contexts by domain (auth, chat, ui, etc.)
- Create custom hooks to access context (e.g., `useChatState`)

---

## State Management

### Local State

- Use `useState` for component-specific state
- Use multiple state variables for unrelated state
- Use `useReducer` for complex state logic

### Context API

- Use Context for sharing state across components
- Create specific contexts for different domains
- Provide helper functions in context to modify state

### Forms

- Use React Hook Form for complex forms
- Implement consistent validation patterns
- Handle form submission and errors gracefully

## File Organization

```

├── api/                  # API service layers
├── assets/               # Static assets (images, icons)
├── chat methods/         # Chat utility functions
├── components/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── common/           # Very generic UI components
│   └── specific/         # App-specific components
├── context/              # React Context providers
├── hooks/                # Custom React hooks
├── pages/                # Page components
├── tests/                # Test files mirroring src structure
├── themes/               # Theme configuration
├── utils/                # Utility functions
├── index.css             # Global styles
└── main.jsx              # App entry point
```

## Testing

### Test Structure

- Group tests by component or functionality
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Keep tests independent of each other

### Component Testing

- Test component rendering and interactions
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, context)
- Test different component states
- Verify that events trigger correct actions

### Hook Testing

- Test custom hooks with renderHook
- Verify state changes and returned values
- Test side effects where appropriate

### Coverage

- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths
- Focus on functionality over metrics
- Include edge cases and error states

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques

- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Use useMemo and useCallback appropriately
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Optimize re-renders by avoiding unnecessary state changes

### Code Splitting

- Use lazy loading for routes
- Split large components into smaller ones
- Use dynamic imports for heavy libraries

### Image Optimization

- Use appropriate image formats (WebP when possible)
- Implement responsive images
- Lazy load images not in the viewport

---

## Accessibility

### Guidelines

- Ensure proper semantic HTML
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy
- Include proper ARIA attributes when needed
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly

### Focus Management

- Ensure focus is managed appropriately in modals and drawers
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Color and Contrast

- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

Remember that these standards should evolve with the project and team. Regular code reviews and discussions about improvements to these standards are encouraged.
